<h1>CSC490: Homework 2</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>In this homework you'll program Asteroids in Java using the Minueto library. It will teach you some more advanced physics and collision detection.</p>
<p>You can read about Asteroids (and play it) <a href="http://www.atari.com/arcade/arcade.php?game=asteroids">here</a>. In your implementation, there are the following changes:<br>
</p><ul>
<li>All asteroids are circular. No fancy shapes.</li>
<li>There are three levels of asteroids: radius 12, radius 6, and radius 3. When shot, the large ones split into two of the smaller kind. When the smallest kind get shot, they disappear.</li>
<li>Asteroids do not pass through each other as in the original game; they bounce off each other based on their velocities before the bounce (apply basic physics).</li>
<li>There are no enemy ships.</li>
<li>The player ship has a velocity and a rotation. When the up-arrow key is applied, it receives a thrust in the direction of its rotation. When the down-arrow key is applied, it receives a thrust in the direction opposite to its rotation.</li>
<li>Asteroids come on screen with random velocities (within sensible limits). Also, there can be a lot of asteroids on screen. Use a large resolution for your main frame, so that you can have as many as possible.</li>
</ul>
