<h1>CSC490: Homework 5</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>In this homework you'll use the <a href="http://cs.oswego.edu/~alex/teaching/csc490/asteroidsfw/index.html">asteroidsfw</a> framework for the first time. Get yourself acknowledged with it, if you have not done so already.</p>
<p>We'll practice steering behaviors in HW5. Since you have a bit less time than usual, the homework is going to be very simple.
</p><p>Implement a ship mind that has the following very simplistic steering behaviors:
</p><ul>
<li>SteerApproach: steer the agent directly towards the closest asteroid.</li>
<li>SteerPursuit: a child of SteerApproach, it does the same thing, only tries to approach the <i>future</i> position of the closest asteroid in order to intercept it if it is moving.</li>
<li>SteerArrive: a child of SteerPursuit, does the same thing, only slows down as it gets close to the arrival point to provide smooth-looking movement of the ship.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If you want and have time, you can also implement SteerEvade, SteerAvoidWall, SteerAvoidBorder, and SteerWander. Ask me if some of these are unclear, of course. The combination of these four and the above three should give the ship very human-like motion.</p>
