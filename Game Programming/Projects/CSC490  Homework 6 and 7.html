<h1>CSC490: Homework 6 and 7</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<p>In this homework you'll use the <a href="http://cs.oswego.edu/~alex/teaching/csc490/asteroidsfw/index.html">asteroidsfw</a> framework again.</p>
<p>In this homework you will implement a genetic algorithm that will improve the Evade state. The gene design is very simple: a gene is just two chars, the first value signifying the thrust of the ship (forward, reverse, or none), and the second one representing an integer between 0 and 17 signifying the sector in which the AI wants the ship to point. (We define a sector to be 20 degrees, so a full circle has 18 of them.)</p>
<p>The three questions that we'll use to determine the genome are:
</p><ul>
<li>How fast is the ship moving toward the asteroid? (We'll discuss how to get an exact value for this in class.) We'll quantize the value into a manageable range in a scale of 0-9, giving us 10 possible states.</li>
<li>What direction are the asteroid and the ship moving in? (get the value here and place it in a sector between 0 and 17, giving us 18 states.)</li>
<li>What is the separation distance? (four states)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The number of distinct evasion scenarios we get is 10*18*4 = 720. If we have a ship that knows how to evade in every one of these, it will be pretty good at evading. Your task is to find a good genome with the 720 genes in it by using a genetic algorithm.</p>
